# A movie database App with React Native
Assignment 1:
Build a movie database App with React Native!

You are tasked to build and design a movie database app, using the elements from the lectures. You are NOT supposed to use all of them, but you have to use some and explain why/why not you didn't decide to utilize elements.

Examples of technologies that you could use:


- **FlatList**: A performant interface for rendering basic lists.
- **SectionList**: Used to render lists with section headers.
- **ScrollList**: A custom component for handling scrolling lists.
- **React Navigation**: Navigation library for handling routes and transitions in React Native apps.
- **ContextProvider**: Provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props manually.

## For Windows
Firstly install the project from GitHub and place it somewhere easily accessible from your driver, for example if your drive is named C:, then the location should be something like:
```
C:\MobileApps\
```
Open up your preferred Shell, if you don’t have any or don’t know what that is Node.js should have installed PowerShell. In the shell, which should look like a terminal, write:
```
npm install -g expo-cli
```
This should install the tool to run our mobile app after that go to where you placed the app, which can be done by the command:
```
cd ~
```
followed by:
```
cd <LOCATION>
```
for example
``` 
cd /MobileApps/retireditems
```
Remember to go into the folder that the app is in. Then to start the mobile app run the commands:
```
npm install
npx expo start
```
