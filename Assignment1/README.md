# A movie database App with React Native
Assignment 1:
Build a movie database App with React Native!

You are tasked to build and design a movie database app, using the elements from the lectures. You are NOT supposed to use all of them, but you have to use some and explain why/why not you didn't decide to utilize elements.

Examples of technologies that you could use:


- **FlatList**: A performant interface for rendering basic lists.
- **SectionList**: Used to render lists with section headers.
- **ScrollList**: A custom component for handling scrolling lists.
- **React Navigation**: Navigation library for handling routes and transitions in React Native apps.
- **ContextProvider**: Provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props manually.
