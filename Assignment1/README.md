Assignment 1:
Build a movie database App with React Native!

You are tasked to build and design a movie database app, using the elements from the lectures. You are NOT supposed to use all of them, but you have to use some and explain why/why not you didn't decide to utilize elements.

Examples of technologies that you could use:


- **FlatList**: A performant interface for rendering basic lists.
- **SectionList**: Used to render lists with section headers.
- **ScrollList**: A custom component for handling scrolling lists.
- **React Navigation**: Navigation library for handling routes and transitions in React Native apps.
- **ContextProvider**: Provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props manually.

## For Windows
Firstly install the project from GitHub and place it somewhere easily accessible from your driver, for example if your drive is named C:, then the location should be something like:
```
C:\MobileApps\
```
Open up your preferred Shell, if you don’t have any or don’t know what that is Node.js should have installed PowerShell. In the shell, which should look like a terminal, write:
```
npm install -g expo-cli
```
This should install the tool to run our mobile app after that go to where you placed the app, which can be done by the command:
```
cd ~
```
followed by:
```
cd <LOCATION>
```
for example
``` 
cd /MobileApps/retireditems
```
Remember to go into the folder that the app is in. Then to start the mobile app run the commands:
```
npm install
npx expo start
```
## For Linux
You’ll probably install npm at the same time but if not, remember to do that. When that is done, run the command:
```
npm install -g expo-cli
```
After that, go where the app is with cd, and if you don’t know how to do that run the commands:
```
cd ~
cd <Location>
```
e.g.
```
cd \MobileApps\retireditems
```
Remember to go into the folder that the app is in, after that run the commands:
```
npm install
npx expo start
```
And pray with all your might to your lord and saviour Richard “Milos” Stallman that it worked. That should be it on the computer side, there’ll be a last section for how to run the application on your phone.

## For Mac OS
Then open up your terminal which is located in “Utilities” where your applications are, or use Spotlight to find the terminal, after opening up the terminal, if everything is good and well, run the command:
```
npm install -g expo-cli
```
This should install the tool that’ll let you run the app. Then go to the place where you have the app in your terminal, by using the commands:
```
cd ~
cd <path to the folder>
```
Remember to go into the folder where the app is, and then start the system that’ll let you run the mobile app, run the command:
```
npm install
npx expo start
```
And that should be it on the computer side, there’ll be a last section for how to run the application on your phone.

## To run the app on the phone
To run our application, after you’ve run the command “npx expo start” successfully, you’ll have to download the app ”expo go”, and also connect to the same internet as your computer, in it I’ll have a QR code reader, scan your given QR code and presto, the app now runs (after an initial installation).
